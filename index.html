                                Howdy! My name is Taylor Johnson. I currently work as a Senior Manager of Software Engineering at Cigna Healthcare. Specifically, I manage the delivery of digital analytics for Cigna's largest web assets. My team consists of full stack engineers, quality engineers, project managers, and scrum masters. Prior to my current role, I worked as a Systems Analysis Manager, Project Manager, and Developer.

                                I graduated from the University of Georgia with a Bachelor of Business Adminstration (BBA) specializing in Management Information Systems (MIS). I have always had a keen interest in Information Technology which started at early age when my grandfather bought me my first personal computer - a Packard Bell. In high school, I built my own web sites for fun and took Java classes to get more familiar with coding. While my career has been always been in IT, I only coded for about year out of college. Times and technology have seriously evolved since then. In order to be a better leader and deeply understand the work my team does, I chose to enroll in the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp.

                                In my free time, I enjoy running half marathons, working in the yard, and learning new things in the technology world (Shocker!). I am also an avid fan of both the Georgia Bulldogs and Miami Dolphins. My passion outside of work is offshore fishing, particularly in the Florida Keys. However, I have fished many waters across North America ranging from Cabo San Lucas to St. Lucia to the small streams of the Great Smoky Mountains. My bucket list locations to fish are Costa Rica, Patagonia, and the Sechelles.
